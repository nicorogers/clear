      <h2>Our Mission</h2>

      <p>
        Helping you feel at ease about your finances, so you can focus on living the life you want.
      </p>

      <p>
        Life is not about earning or saving as much as possible.<br>
        It’s about finding the right balance — where money is a tool that supports your life,
        instead of shaping it unconsciously.
      </p>

      <p>
        Clear exists to help you find that balance, while spending as little of your time and attention
        on it as possible.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Who is it for</h2>

      <p>Clear is for people who:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>are tired of spreadsheets, categories, and manual tracking</li>
        <li>don’t want budgeting or discipline systems</li>
        <li>want clarity without losing time getting it</li>
        <li>want money to feel handled, not constantly present</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>What It Does</h2>

      <p>
        Clear is built around simple questions people have about their spending,
        and focuses on giving clear answers to the ones that matter for them.
      </p>

      <p>No spreadsheets, charts or tools.</p>

      <ul>
        <li>How much of my money actually goes to food?</li>
        <li>Where can I buy the same products, but cheaper?</li>
        <li>What is the real cost of owning my house?</li>
        <li>How much do small, everyday purchases really add up to over a month?</li>
        <li>How much can I save per month if I stop going to restaurants?</li>
        <li>How many recurring costs per month do I have?</li>
      </ul>

      <p>One simple question, one simple answer.</p>
    </section>

      <h2>How Clear Works</h2>

      <p>
        Step 1 — You share your spending by scanning or uploading any receipt or invoice at any time.
        The more you share, the better Clear understands your habits and patterns.
        No manual input or categorising is required.
      </p>

      <p>
        Step 2 — You ask Clear a question in plain language, either in writing or by voice.
        There is no need to navigate menus, dashboards, or spreadsheets.
      </p>

      <p>
        Step 3 — Clear gives you a simple answer immediately, either written or spoken.
        Over time, it requires less of your attention.
